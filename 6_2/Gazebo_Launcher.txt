## Launching the simulator environment

source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
roslaunch penguinpi_gazebo ECE4078.launch

## Spawning objects

source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
rosrun penguinpi_gazebo scene_manager.py -l FruitMap.txt
rosrun penguinpi_gazebo scene_manager.py -l map1.txt


## Evaluating RMSE

python3 CV_eval.py TRUEMAP.txt lab_output/targets.txt

## Play around with the rosrun penguinpi_gazebo scene_manager.py command using the following variations:
Run without -l map1.txt tag to spawn objects at random locations
Run with -d tag to remove the spawned objects
Run with -s NAME.txt to save a new map

*map only showing lemons and apples
*slam not working
*no position output
